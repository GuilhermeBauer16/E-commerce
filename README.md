## Learnings 

In that project, I learned how to use Spring Security to create a JWT(JSON Web Token ) token to structure a login system. To encrypt the passwords inside the Database I used the PBKDF2(password-based Key Derivation Function 2). I chose that password encryptor for the capability of customizing and for the security that PBKDF2 has. I also learned how to create unit tests using Mockito and JUnit. I already made a post about my learning about Mockito and JUnit. I will share the link below.
